# force-localhost-ca
WordPress curl requests (used in wp_remote_get, etc) use a CA cert file in WP Core, not the system PHP path. Use this drop in plugin (easiest in /wp-content/mu-plugins) to fix the issue on localhost. Helpful for compatibility with local SSL certs generated by the mkcert command.
